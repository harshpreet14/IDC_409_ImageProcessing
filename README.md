# 📌 Face Recognition Attendance System 

## Overview

This project implements a face recognition-based attendance system using Python libraries. The system captures video from a webcam, recognizes faces, and updates attendance information in a csv file.

## Setting up the Development Environment
<a name="setting-up-the-development-environment"></a>

1. Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release) to download the Python version 3.6.8 on your local system.
2. Create a empty folder and run the following command in the terminal.
   ```https://github.com/harshpreet14/IDC_409_ImageProcessing.git```
3. Next, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
   
To build our face recognition attendance system, we will need the following Python libraries:
*OpenCV*: For computer vision tasks such as face detection and image processing.
*Dlib*: A powerful library that provides facial landmark detection and face alignment capabilities.
*face_recognition*: A Python library built on top of dlib, designed specifically for face recognition tasks.
*Pandas*: For managing and analyzing the attendance data.
